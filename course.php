  	Learning to fly is a personal challenge that offers a chance to do something really different. The process can teach you as much about yourself and your skills as about flying an aircraft. You will develop improved self discipline and self-analysis as you learn to safely operate these machines.
<br><br>
Learning to fly is not as hard as you might think. In fact, each year many people of all ages and from all walks of life learn to fly. You can start learning as early as when you are 16 years old, though you must be 17 yrs to obtain a private pilot´s licence (PPL) and 18 yrs to obtain a Commercial Pilot´s License (CPL).
<br><br>
Garg Aviation offers flight training for all DGCA licenses, from private pilot through flight instructor and airline transport pilot, in a professional environment. The training can be conducted full time or part time depending on your schedule.
<br><br>
To receive your private pilot license, you will have to take flight training, gain solo flight experience, a written exam and a practical test. Similar Is the case for other courses although as the importance of the license increases so does the standards on which the training is required to be given. Although it is not necessary to have a Private pilot license in order to get your commercial pilot license, however from our experience we suggest that every student undergoing CPL training must first obtain his PPL then proceed on to for clearing the CPL written examinations. That way you will have a good idea of the examination system and having a PPL also gives much more confidence and privileges.
<br><br>
During your training some of the things you will learn are general handling of the airplane (straight and level flight, climbs, descents, turns, airspeed changes, slow flight, steep turns and stalls), take offs and landings, visual and radio navigation, radio communications, cross country flying, and emergency procedures.
<br><br>
After about 15 hours of flight training you will probably be ready for your first solo flight. In addition to your flight training you also have to take written exams which are conducted by the DGCA every three months and there is no restriction as to the number of times you can appear in these written exams. You will receive ground instruction in conjunction with your flight training, and much of that instruction will also be helpful in preparing you for the written exams. The best time to take the written exams is when your flight training is about 50% completed. This way you will be able to use the practical experience you have gained during your flight training to help you with the written exams. If you have difficulty with any of the study material, your instructor can help you with it.

  </p>
   <p class="container" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-top: 9px;" hidden="">This course is much similar to the CPL course except for the fact that you also receive 15 hours of training on a multi engine aircraft for issue of multi engine rating and the training required for issue of instrument rating which is beneficial for you when you apply in any airline. Since instrument rating is a must in airlines and having a multi engine rating gives you added advantage over other applicants.
<br><br>
The total flying hours which you will do will still remain 200 hrs but you will do 185 hrs on single engine aircraft and 15 hours on multi engine aircraft. The necessary requirements for issue of Instrument rating on both single and multi engine aircrafts will be completed within the 200 hrs of training.
</p>
   <p class="container" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-top: 9px;">
   	GAL utilises a Cessna 310 multi engine aircraft for providing multi engine training. Over the years numerous students have received multi engine training with GAL. Pilots who come for multi engine rating at GAL include military pilots including those from Airforce, Navy and Coast guard.
<br><br>
Pilots prefer us for multi engine training because of the low training costs as compared to other academies, no hidden charges, transparency in working and our reputation of honouring our commitments. Depending upon the weather conditions and other instrumental factors including the number of flying hours which you have to do, the training can be completed in 4-5 days and even less for defence forces personnel who have obtained reduced syllabus from DGCA.
<br><br>
Short term lodging and fooding facilities are also available at nominal charges for students coming for multi engine flying.
   </p>
   <p class="container" style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-top: 9px;" hidden="">
   	Section Q of Schedule II of the Aircraft Rules lays down the requirements a candidate must meet in order to be eligible for issue of Assistant Flight Instructor rating which are as follows:
<br><br>
Requirements for issue of Rating– An applicant for an Assistant Flight Instructor´s Rating shall satisfy the following requirements :–
<br><br>
<b>(a) Age–</b> You shall be not less than eighteen years of age on the date of submission of documents for issue of AFIR(A)
<br><br>
<b>(b) Knowledge–</b> You shall have to pass a written or oral examination in the following subjects in accordance with the prescribed syllabus :–
<br><br>
(i) Mechanics of flight;

<br><br>
<b>Experience–</b> He shall produce evidence of having satisfactorily completed as pilot of an aeroplane within a period of five years immediately preceding the date of application for this rating :
<br><br>
(i) not less than two hundred hours of flight time as a Pilot-in Command of an aeroplane of which not less than fifty hours shall have been completed within a period of eighteen months immediately preceding the date of application; and in the case of helicopters, not less than one hundred hours flight time as a Pilot-in-Command of a helicopter, of which not less than fifty hours shall have been completed within a period of eighteen months immediately preceding the date of application;
<br><br>
(ii) not less than ten hours of flying training as an Instructor as per the syllabus prescribed by the Director-General under an approved Flight Instructor/Examiner.

   	GAL also offers recency/conversion training to students who have completed their training in foreign countries and are now seeking conversion of license for issue of Indian licenses. As we all know that about 20 hrs of flight time is such which is valid for only about 6 months and most students going abroad face difficulty when they come back since by the time they pass their written examinations in India, the six months time period gets lapsed which means they again have to do about 20 hours of flying.
<br><br>
At GAL we will help you meet the requirements for recency so that you are able to apply for issue of Indian license on the basis of your foreign license. All our aircrafts including the Cessna 152 and Cessna 310 are IFR approved. All your recency flying requirements including your day flying, night flying, 250 NM day cross country check, 120 NM night cross country check, instrument flying, instrument rating test and day/night tests can be done in our Cessna 152 or Cessna 310 as per your requirements. Both aircrafts are readily available and depending upon your requirements and the weather conditions, the recency flying takes about 7-10 days although if things permit it is possible to complete this training in even shorter duration.
<br><br>
The most difficulty which students face is with instrument rating test since the DGCA requires you to have done IR test with two different types of instrument approaches and most flying academies in the country do not have easy access to airports with two instrument approaches and in other cases such airports are extremely far away. At GAL the instrument rating test is usually carried out at Chakeri Airport which has got ILS, Localiser, VOR and NDB approaches, enough to meet the DGCA requirements and Chakeri is only 3 NM away from Kanpur Civil airport which is almost like being at the same airport. So unlike other flying training academies where you might have to spend your hard earned money on first flying to an airport where there are two different instrument approaches and then do the test, at our academy you can save a major amount of your expenditure on this.
<br><br>
At GAL you will find that unlike other flying training academies which start levying new/hidden charges as your training progresses, we believe in transparent working. All fees, costs and expenditures involved in the training are made known to you the first time you contact us so that once you start your training you are prepared and confident that your expenditures won�t exceed the estimates.
<br><br>
Short term lodging and fooding facilities are also available at nominal charges for students coming for recency/conversion flyin
